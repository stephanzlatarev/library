Release planning - Library partners with "The Digital Library"

===== creational patterns =====
* Library offers a catalog browser to "The Digital Library"
- use singleton and its factory
- injection via constructor
- lazy initialization
- object pool 

===== structural patterns =====
* The catalog browser of the library can work with local catalog and "The Digital Library"
- implement against raw interface
- use a facade to simplify interaction with raw interface
- (DIP) implement against class ?
- LendingDesk uses an adapter to 
- implement against raw interface

* Keep statistics on searches of titles from "The Digital Library" so that the library can optimize own copies
- use a proxy to decouple client from object
- do not use proxy and add counting at all possible places with if clauses

===== behavioural patterns =====
* Library users can reserve expected titles and get book copy via mail service
- observer

* Reservations are served with returned copies; exception if copy is damaged
- strategy pattern
- template method

===== concurrency patterns =====
* Library is available online and need to become thread-safe
- thread pool
- monitor object
- optimistic locking


---- to do ----
- a change list with cast to specific class even though interface works
- a change that copies a large method into a separate class and leaves a duplicate
